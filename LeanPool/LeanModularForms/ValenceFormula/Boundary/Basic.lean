# Fundamental Domain Boundary – Basic Definitions

Definitions and continuity for the boundary of the standard fundamental domain
for SL₂(ℤ), both at fixed height `heightCutoff` and at variable height `H`.

## Main Definitions

* `heightCutoff` — fixed cutoff height (√3/2 + 1)
* `fdBoundary` — 5-segment boundary at fixed height
* `fdBoundaryH` — 5-segment boundary at variable height H
* `fdPartition` — interior partition points
* `fdBoundaryFullPartition` — full partition including endpoints
* `fdBoundaryHPartition` — partition for H-parameterized boundary
* `seg5QRadiusH` — q-expansion radius e^(-2πH)
