# Bridge to Mathlib's Huang Theorem

Repackages Mathlib's `Sensitivity.huang_degree_theorem` (the Huang hypercube
lemma) in a form that uses `Finset (Fin (m+1) → Bool)` and the `flipBit`
predicate from `LeanPool.Sensitivity.Defs`, ready to feed into the
sensitivity-conjecture argument.

The Mathlib formalisation in `Archive.Sensitivity` originated in the
[lean-sensitivity](https://github.com/leanprover-community/lean-sensitivity)
project, a community formalisation of Huang's proof carried out shortly after
the original paper appeared in 2019.

/-- A finset-flavoured restatement of Mathlib's
`Sensitivity.huang_degree_theorem`: any subset `H` of the hypercube of size
at least `2^m + 1` contains a vertex `q` with at least `√(m+1)` neighbours
in `H`, where neighbours are bit-flip images `flipBit q i`. -/
